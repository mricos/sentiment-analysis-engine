|---|---|
|Codebase|Gitlab|
|Dependencies|npm & custom shell scripting & env for dependency isolation|

|Processes|Shell script kicks off 2 processes: static server and API endpoint|
|Port binding| All ports are defined in .env and added at build time|
|Concurreny | Define a shell script to start and stop processes via GitLab CI/CD|

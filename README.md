## 12 Factors

|Factor| Implementation Strategy|
|---|---|
|Codebase|Gitlab|
|Dependencies|npm & custom shell scripting & env for dependency isolation|
|Config|Store keys in .env file|
|Backing services|Twitter API & Google Translate API, no file-based io. Investigating [reload module at runtime](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26633901/reload-module-at-runtime)|
|Build, release, run|Use npm build system and GitLab CI/CD|
|Processes|Shell script kicks off 2 processes: static server and API endpoint|
|Port binding| All ports are defined in .env and added at build time|
|Concurreny | Define a shell script to start and stop processes via GitLab CI/CD|
|Disposability|Handle SIGTERM and possibly handle events with a task queue.|
|Dev/prod parity|No database, 2 branches: dev and master, daily merges, smaill team, dev tools all Unix|
|Logs|All output to stdout, aggregated by process management script|
|Admin processes|Support a REPL, support remote shell commands, separate admin dir|
